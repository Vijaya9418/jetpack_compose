**What is Jetpack Compose?**

It is an Android's recommended morden toolkit for creating native UI, accelerating UI components. It is a new way of writing UI directly in code.

for example:- If you want to show the list of names in a UI for that if we are using the xml then we will have to go to a lot of process such as, creating a recycler view, adapter and xml file and a lot of code in java file, but if we will use jetpack compose we can do the same thing in seven lines of code.
