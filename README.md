**What is Jetpack Compose?**

It is an Android's recommended morden toolkit for creating native UI, accelerating UI components. It is a new way of writing UI directly in code.

for example:- If you want to show the list of names in a UI for that if we are using the xml then we will have to go to a lot of process such as, creating a recycler view, adapter and xml file and a lot of code in java file, but if we will use jetpack compose we can do the same thing in seven lines of code.

**Why Compose?**

1. One language for everything, including UI.
2. It proposes a declarative approach. It means the activity does not depend on the xml.
    Declarative approach:-

   but now with the help of jetpack compose we dont have to depend on any xml to update something on UI as it follows.<br>

   Imperative approach:-

   Which means, if we want to set any text then we will have to depend on xml to tell that I want to set this text or this layout to the UI, which results in activity depending on xml to do the changes in UI stuff.
